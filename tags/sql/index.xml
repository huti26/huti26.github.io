      <description>Preface Discord is a popular chatting platform and there are plenty of bots available, which can entertain you and your friends. There are bots out there, that post images from for example Reddit. The bots do not post the image itself, instead, they post the link to the image, and Discord itself will embed the image into the chat. Pixiv is a Japanese platform on which artists share their creations. At the time I created this bot, embedding images from Pixiv was blocked.</description>
