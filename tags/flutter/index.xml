      <description>Preface Flutter is first and foremost a Framework to create cross-platform applications, but it can also be used to create WebApps. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have any experience with the three big Web Frameworks: VueJS, React, and Angular, I thought Flutter would be a good fit for me. It also uses Dart instead Javascript. My initial impression was, that this is also an improvement. Since I have not made any proper experiences with other Web Frameworks or Javascript, I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to compare those to Flutter/Dart in this article.</description>
